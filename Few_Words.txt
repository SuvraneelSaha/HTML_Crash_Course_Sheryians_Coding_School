we will be leaning very few things 

the thing is that there is no need to learn 100% of html or any other topics or technology 
even all the worlds best developers dont learn everything 
they just learn enough so that they get the job done 
and when the job demands something more 
they simply just learn that 

they dont think no no no i need to first become a master in html and then and then only 
i will be able to switch to css 

its dumb shit right bullshit absolutely bullshit

Pareto Principle - 80% of the questions  come from 20% of things or syllabus 

so master the 20% the rest will be handled automatically when the time will come
