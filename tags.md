but 0 height ; height nehi hoti 

div ke height apne children ki height ke barabaar hoti hein

Understanding ID : 
the problem arises when a single entity decides the value of different tags and elements 
say for example - two p elements are there 
we need to change the color of the 1st p element 
but when we use a single entity like p 
then both the p elements will be changed in properties 

id name cannot be repeated ; whereas the class name can be used multiple times 

when id use - # 
and when class use - .
